#I can add bookmarks to my list. Each bookmark contains a title, url link, description, and a rating from 1 to 5 stars.

#I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app.

#All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating.

#I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view.

#The detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" button.

#I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list.

#I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark.

#I can select, from a dropdown, a "minimum rating" filter to list all bookmark rated at or above the chosen selection.
